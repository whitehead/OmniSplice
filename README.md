Welcome to the omnisplice read me.

# patch note
> 0.5
> A - Omnisplice statistical approaches have been reworked, and instead of a logistic glm, provides both beta binomila model and t-test. the reason is that the logistic binomial sensible to overdispersion. To so so Omnisplice uses a R code that uses established library, so you need R and Rscript on your path. our benchmark show a correlation of p-value of 0.995 (Pearson). 

> B - compare_conditions now as a new parameter '--thread' allowing you to use multi threading. This is usefull because the new test (beta binomial) is way slower.

> C - I changed the output of "compare_conditions" adding CI cohensh psidelta, and the osition are now represented as chr:start-end(strand). 


Omnisplice is a tool to categorize all reads present at exon's extremity.

## To keep in mind
The same read will be counted as many time as a read overlap different feature.
even it is the same position (different transcript same gene).


## Quick uses
```

the standard pipe-line that I uses:


you first need to run OmniSplice for all your sorted index bam file:
omni_splice --gtf <gtf file> --input <indexBamFile> -o <outFilePrefix> --anchor 3

then run compares conditions
compare_conditions run-all --control-files control1.junction control2.junction --treatment-files treatment1.junction treatment2.junction  --min-read 10  --outfile-prefix <out file> --thread 10




# specify the lib type for unstranded data
omni_splice --gtf <gtf file> --input <indexBamFile> -o <outFilePrefix> --Libtype Unstranded

# extending the overhang to 5 pb
omni_splice --gtf <gtf file> --input <indexBamFile> -o <outFilePrefix> --overhang 5 


# to get exon_others and associated bam files:
omni_splice --gtf <gtf file> --input <indexBamFile> -o <outFilePrefix> --read-to-write-junc  exon-other clipped


# for backsplicing you need to first extract the clipped reads
omni_splice --gtf <gtf file> --input <indexBamFile> -o <outFilePrefix> --read-to-write soft-clipped

# then you need bowtie 2 in your OS path, plus a bowtie 2 reference for your genome
backsplicing -i <omnisplice_out.clipped> -o <outputPrefix>> -b <bowtie2 ref> -g <gtf> -m <min clipped size, default 20> 

# for comparison 
compare_conditions run-all --control-files control1.junction control2.junction --treatment-files treatment1.junction treatment2.junction  --min-read 10  --outfile-prefix <out file> --thread 10

# specific splicing category
compare_conditions run --control-files control1.junction control2.junction --treatment-files treatment1.junction treatment2.junction  --min-read 10  --outfile-prefix <out file> --splicing-fail  Unspliced Clipped Exon_other --splicing-ok Spliced --thread 10


# quick plot of genes (barplot as in manuscript)
coming out soon!
```
python gene_visualisation.py --group1 control_S1.junctions control_S2.junctions --group1_name  Control --group2 mutant_S1.junctions mutant_S2.junctions --group2_name mutant  --gene_list gene_id1 gene_id2 --outfile_prefix outname


## Installation

you need R and Rscript on your path with those library available:
>aod
>data.table
>parallel

to use omni splice you need access to a linux machine (mac never tested).
you need rust, to install rust go to (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
you also need cmake. (brew install cmake on mac.)

```
# Clone this repository using git
> git clone <####>
> cd omnisplice
> cargo build --release
# this is a compilation command it will output a bunch of text including some wanring
# and should finish with: "Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) "
you can add target directory to your path
```

omnisplice executables will then be at <path>/omnisplice/target/release/omni_splice
if you want to add it to your Path, you can add the release directory to your ~/.bashrc.
example:
export PATH=${PATH}:"<PATH TO>/omnisplice/target/release/"


if you encouter any error, have any questions, want to propose improvment
or let us now by opening a new issue on this github.




### Rust installation
    To see if you have rust installed type "cargo" on the command line, if the terminal return a line with "command not found" you need to install it.
    It is very easy just follow this link: 
        https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
    
    if you have rust installed you may need to update it:   
        rustup update


## Input Files
    - gtf: The gtf must have a valid "gene_id" and "transcript_id" for every feature annotated as "exon".
    omnisplice will look at all the exon in this file. if you want to limit your search to subset of gene or exon.
    only include the one your are interested in. (this is particularly helpfull when using the "readToWrite" option as to limit the size of the output).
    - input: a valid position sorted indexed **bam file**


## Command details
    required:
        --input -i  <sortedIndexedBamFile>
        --output -o <outFilePrefix>
        --gtf -g <gtfFile>
    optional: 
        --mapq <Minimum mapq default 13>
        --LibType <Rna seq libtype, default frFirstStrand>
        --overhang <default 1>
        --flag_in <Bam flag a read must have>
        --flag_out <Bam flag a read must not have>
        --readToWrite <used to output read of a specific category>
        --unspliced_def <used for splicing efficiency default unspliced>
        --spliced_def <used for splicing efficiency default spliced>

## Strandness and libtype

Omnisplice by default expect reverse pair end reads.

the libtype argument can be confusing. But it represent your librairy layout and if relevant is helpfull to determine the strandedness of your reads.

- **fr** imply that your paired reads are oriented towards each other (most/majority of modern layout uses this)

    --> <--

- **ff**

    --> -->

- **rf**

    <-- -->


- **FirstStrand** imply that your sequencing reads ar reverse complemented compare to the reference genome

- **SecondStrand** imply that your sequencing reads are NOT reverse complemented compared to the reference genome

### In case of **unstranded** data uses:
- Unstranded (for single end layout)
- PairedUnstranded (for pair end)

OmniSplice uses the flag from the alignment + the layout information (libtype argument) to determine the strandedness of a reads. It does that using a library I made you can check up the code here: https://github.com/rLannes/BAMstrandSpecifier



## Context and discussion.
    OmniSplice does not consume much ressource. Execution time will depend on the size of the bam, and the number of chromosome in the gtf. Memory  will depend on the number of "exon" Feature in the gtf .



## Output Files
    category file (.tsv file): 
        Chromosome | Position of the feature | gene ID | transcript ID | Strand | ExonType | ReadCategory | Read Support
        for each feature they are as many line as ReadCategory found for this specific feature

    with:
        ExonType:   [Donnor | Acceptor] indicate if the exon extremity is a junction donnor of acceptor.
            Note: the start of the gene is Acceptor, the end of the gene is Donnor.
        
        ReadCategory:
            * ReadJunction(n, m) -> junction read from n, m
            * Unspliced -> read is unspliced
            * Skipped(n, m) -> skipped , read has junction from  n to m that include the feature. 
            * SoftClipped -> Read is clipped at the junction.
            * Empty -> not read found at this junction
            * WrongStrand -> The read come from a fragment which strand is different feom the feature
            * FailPosFilter -> the way the algorithm works to reduce the number of comparison may give some false positive. 
                you can discard it, no meaningfull biologicaly.
            * OverhangFail -> The read fail the overhang test.
            * Unexpected -> if you see this please open a bug report.

    both exon and junction file describe events. But the exon file give the detail by exon end whereas the junction file give the results per junction.

    the exon file (.tsv file):
        contig | gene_name | transcript_name | exon_number | ambiguous | strand | pos | next | exon_type | spliced | unspliced | clipped | exon_other | skipped  | wrong_strand | e_isoform
    
    the junction file (.tsv file):
        contig | gene_name | transcript_name | intron_number | strand | ambiguous | Donnor | Acceptor | spliced | unspliced | clipped | exon_other | skipped  | wrong_strand | e_isoform



## Algorithm overview

```
For each read find all exon extremity it does overlap.
for each read R:
    for each extremity E:
        Test if fail pos filter.
        Test if the strand match. -> if False Wrong Strand
        Test if the read skipped the junction.
        Tesf if the read fail the overhang.
        Test if the read is unspliced at the feature specifically.
        Test if the read is SoftClipped.
        Test if the read is a Junction read.
